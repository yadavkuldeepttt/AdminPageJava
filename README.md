## Introduction

This README provides an overview of a web application developed using Java, HTML, CSS, JSP (JavaServer Pages), and JavaScript. The primary features of this application include user registration, login, accessing user data, updating user data, and deleting user data.

## Technologies Used

- Java: The backend logic of the application is written in Java.
- HTML: Used for creating the structure of web pages.
- CSS: Used for styling the web pages and enhancing user interface.

Once logged in, users can access their own data and perform the following actions:

- View their profile information
- Update their profile information
- Delete their account

### Updating User Data

Users have the option to update their profile information, such as changing their password, email, or other details.

### Deleting User Data

Users can delete their accounts, which will remove their data from the database.
